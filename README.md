# Flutter - Fall 2018 Session <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5-aoK8IBmXve5whBQM90GA.png" alt="Flutter Logo" width="100"/>

**Submit your app ideas [here](https://goo.gl/forms/mzWKkZCYkAulqWPf1)**

### This is where all code in the session will be located

### ***UPDATE***:
If you are on windows and are having trouble running the Android Emulator and Intel HAXM is already installed, then you might have to enable Intel Hardware Virtualization in BIOS.<br/><br/>To do this, restart your computer and click one of <kbd>F1</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>F10</kbd>, <kbd>delete</kbd>, or <kbd>esc</kbd> when booting up depending on your manufacturer (You can also look up "BIOS keyboard shortcut for &lt;your computer type&gt;"). Then go to advanced and Enable Intel Virtualization Technology. Finally reboot again and check to see if this works.<br/><br/>If this does not work, then some other solutions are available [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21635504/error-during-installing-haxm-vt-x-not-working).
